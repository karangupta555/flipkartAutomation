# flipkartAutomation
It is a project on Flipkart Aumtomation using puppeteer.js.
Puppeteer is a automation library which provides a high level API to control chromium.
So, what it does is it goes to flipkart page and enter details like username and password and click on login.
After that it searches the product and sort it by popularity.
Then, it goes to the 1st product and add that item to the cart.
And goes to the cart and does all the paymenr process like clicking on delivery address, payment option etc. 
Then, clicks on confrim order.
Finally, it captures tha screenshot of the product order placed page.
Thank you.
